## Electricity Load and Price Forecasting for Short Term Period

**Project abstract:** 
Electricity trading has grown with superlative rapidity. It is a special form of commodity 
as it cannot be stored, and electricity price is too volatile. The cost of over-contracting 
or under-contracting and then buying or selling electricity is so high that it can even lead to 
bankruptcy. ***This project aims to make a high-frequency short-range price forecast to take electricity trading 
decisions at asset as well as macro-level for the deregulated Alberta Canada market.***

> Using an accurate price forecast, energy supply companies would be able to optimize their 
procurement strategies. Companies can also schedule their operations according to the low-price 
zones. In a nutshell, it will enable users to make informed energy trading decisions.

**Analytics Problem Statement:**
• To predict hourly electricity load for Alberta Canada 
• To forecast hourly electricity price based on above predicted load

### 1. Feature space 
Forecasting energy prices is a function of load prediction. Various parameters like historical load, 
climate data, and calendar information were considered for forecasting load at an hourly interval of 
time and in succession load, and other variables were considered to forecast price for the day-ahead 
market in Alberta Canada. 

### 2. Project Lifecycle 
The overall modeling framework adopted for this study can be summarized in the below infographic.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

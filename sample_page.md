## Electricity Load and Price Forecasting for Short Term Period

**Project abstract:** 
The energy trading industry has developed and made progress with uttermost rapidity in the last few 
years. Electricity is now traded under market rules using spot and derivative contracts in many 
countries across the world. Alberta currently operates a wholesale power market that sets a price for 
electricity every hour for the whole year that determines the revenue for generators as well as the 
cost for consumers.
However, electricity is a very special commodity. It is economically non-storable, and power system 
stability requires a constant balance between production and supply. The main factors of the energy 
industry are demand and supply which depend on weather parameters and the intensity of business 
and everyday activities. These features cause some important characteristics of electricity prices: high 
volatility, sharp price spikes, mean-reverting process, and seasonality in different frequencies, among 
others. Because of all these idiosyncratic features, forecasting electricity prices accurately becomes a 
very challenging task.
This project aims to make a high-frequency short-range price forecast to take electricity trading 
decisions at asset as well as macro-level for the deregulated Alberta Canada market. The model will 
be able to help the users to make immediate operational and financial decisions based on deep 
learning models. This will enable electronic trading decisions.
Forecasting energy prices is a function of load prediction. Various parameters like historical load, 
climate data, and calendar information were considered for forecasting load at an hourly interval of 
time and in succession load, and other variables were considered to forecast price for the day-ahead 
market in Alberta Canada. 
Using an accurate price forecast, energy supply companies would be able to optimize their 
procurement strategies. Companies can also schedule their operations according to the low-price 
zones. In a nutshell, it will enable users to make informed energy trading decisions.

**Problem Statement:**
The client has shared the below problem statements:
• To predict hourly electricity load for Alberta Canada 
• To forecast hourly electricity price based on above predicted load

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

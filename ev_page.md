*Optimisation*

**Introduction** 
**The mobility sector accounts for around 18% of the carbon dioxide emissions from 
burning fuel.** A considerable market share of electric vehicles (EVs) running on clean 
power is key to mobility decarbonisation. As the number of EVs on our roads continues 
to increase, the demand for charging is following suit. Today around 10% of drivers are 
choosing EVs when buying a new car, and this is expected to grow rapidly.

**We need 
accelerated technology and infrastructure development to support EV market growth. 
While EV drivers are looking for a charging experience that is as fast and comfortable 
as possible, the main obstacle to mobility decarbonisation is inconvenience caused by 
charging infrastructure and charging time** Proper placement of charging points can 
alleviate this problem. It is a subject of current research and business interest 
simultaneously and has immense implications for the adoption of EVs, including: 
1. lowering range anxiety among EV owners,
2. optimal utilisation of EV charging points,
3. minimal travel time and waiting time for EV owners.
In addition, the challenges around this problem are evolving as EVs penetrate different 
geographies. For example, the EV charging placement in a U.S. city has different nuances than in a 
suburban town in India. 

**The demand for solving 

**Business Objective:**
- To identify actionable drivers of NPS for different geographies


**Analytics Objective:**
- To extract customer satisfaction dimensions (CSDs) from customer feedback data and establish its relationship 
with customer satisfaction to identify key ‘drivers’ of NPS



### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing 
We were pprovided with 1 year of structured customer feedback data (1.78 lac responses) with information such as:
	- customer details like mobile no, name, date of purchase 
	- store code
	- invoice amount 
	- product/brand/category description 
	- ratings, feedback 
	- store reckoner
